# Aerial Cactus Identification

This is a repository for the Jupyter notebook that I wrote and submitted for the Kaggle competition on classifying aerial photographs on whether or not there is a cactus. The notebook cannot be run without the data, which I unfortunately cannot load here due to the competition rules. Please take a look at the [Kaggle competition]( https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification).

This was an exercise in building an advanced CNN after learning about general tips on how to design them. The relatively simple network does pretty well, considering that this competition has public kernels and so there are many entries that use similar, better scoring networks.
